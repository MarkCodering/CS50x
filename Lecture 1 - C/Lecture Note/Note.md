# CS50x - Lecture 1 - C
## Introduction to C Programming Language
C, a traditional and fully-text base but powerful computer programming language. Wiht CS50x, we would like to introduce the C programming language in the following manner:
- Program Structure
- Variable and Beyond
- Control Flow 
- Conclusion

## Introduction to Program Structure
The program structure of a typical C program is shown below:

```C
//Include the libraries:
#include<stdio.h> //Include the standard Input/Output Library.
#include<stdlib.h> //Include the standard library in C programming.

Global Variables Section:
int global_variable; --> A global variable declared in "int" data type

//Entry Point of the Program, main function
void main(void)
{
    //Local Variable Declaration in main() function zone
    int local_variable;

    //Actions (Algorithm)
    printf("Hello World, this is CS50x\n");

    system("PAUSE");
    return 0;
} 
```

## Variables

## Flow Control
