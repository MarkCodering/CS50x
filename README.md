# CS50x From Harvard University with Mark Chen
## This is CS50
Introduction to Intellectual Enterprise of Computer Science and the art of programming created by Prof. David J. Malan from Harvard University. This is CS50x. And, here is the world of computational thinking with Mark Chen from Tamkang University. Together, the lecture, educating while entertaining; the problem, challenging while interesting.

## Course Structure of CS50x
The overall purpose of CS50x is to help student establishing a strong technical knowledge and solid thinking capability in the world of computer science. The course including the essential but demanding topics in computer science and information engineering (CSIE). Throughout this course, I will be able to write program in C and Python, but more importantly, think, computationaly.
